| Our group hopes to implement multiple lays to allow for different types of analysis. |Search bar, colour gradient and filtering countries by poverty level are some propositions targeted to guide the user in exploring the data with ease.. | Add unqiue markers to countries we include case studies on. This will give more background on certian areas. |
